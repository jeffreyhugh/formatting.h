| README: formatting.h |
+----------------------+

formatting.h is a header file containing ANSI escape sequences to help C
programmers make their terminal output look better. All sequences come from
Wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code). 

Inspiration for this file came from the powerlevel10k ZSH theme by romkatv
(https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k).

Some terminals might not support bright colors or italic characters. Use these
with caution.


+-----------+
| Important |
+-----------+

Once you use a code, the terminal will continue to use that code until it gets
another code. Please be courteous of your end user's terminal preferences by
resetting colors and formatting prior to exiting the program.


+----------------+
| Usage Examples |
+----------------+

Since these codes are simply strings, you can use a string replacement in
printf() (%s) to add the strings.

Q) Print a line of bold, red text:
A) printf("%s%sHello, world!%s\n", FG_RED, BOLD, RESET);

Q) Print a line of blue background, green foreground text:
A) printf("%s%sBlue background, green foreground%s", BG_BLUE, FG_GREEN, RESET);

Q) Print an arrow for a user to enter their input:
A) printf("%s input %s%s ", REV, RESET, ARROW);
